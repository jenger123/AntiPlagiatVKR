Tom Canty was very poor. He and his family were paupers. There
were a great many paupers in London in the year 1547. Sometimes the
father of the family couldn't work, and they were paupers for that
reason. But Tom Canty's father didn't want to work. He and his wife and
his mother and his three children all lived in one room in an old house in
the poorest part of London. The children had no beds; they slept on the
floor.
There were two girls, Bet and Nan, and one boy, Tom. Canty
never did any work: every day he sent out his three children to beg for
money in the streets. They had to stand at the side of the road and say,
"Please give a penny to a poor child!" If they didn't bring money to John
Canty in the evening he beat them and gave them no food.
It was a very unhappy life for the children.
Father Andrew lived in the same house. He had a little room at the
back of the house. He was a very learned man. Tom went to sit with
Father Andrew every day, and Father Andrew told him stories about
kings and princes.
Tom said, "I want to be like a prince. I want to speak nicely, as
princes do; and I want to learn Latin, because princes learn Latin." So
Father Andrew taught Tom how to speak nicely and how to be like a
prince, and he taught him Latin.
When Tom was with other boys he played at being a prince.
Sometimes the boys laughed at him and called him Prince Tom, but they
liked him. They played by the river and went swimming in the water.
Tom could swim very well.
